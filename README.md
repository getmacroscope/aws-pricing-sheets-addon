## About the AWS Pricing Plugin

The [AWS Pricing Plug-in](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/aws_pricing/328915503637) is an open-source project maintained by Strake that allows any google sheets user to analyze AWS public pricing using Google Sheets formulas. AWS cost management is a pain. The ability to bring AWS Pricing into Google Sheets and collaborate with your team makes it easier to forecast AWS costs and identify opportunities for savings.

Currently, the plug-in supports Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Elastic Block Store (EBS) and Relational Database Service (RDS) pricing. We're actively looking for feedback and participation in expanding the project. If you have any ideas or want to be involved, let us know in the [Strake Community](https://join.slack.com/t/strake-community/shared_invite/zt-1nisfazzn-uO5O_I28Z7N6sZ6iM2H1xA).

## Get Started
### Step 1: Get the AWS Pricing Plug-in from the Google Workspace Marketplace
Anyone can download the AWS Pricing Plug-in from the [Google Workspace Marketplace](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/aws_pricing/328915503637).

If you are a Google Workspace Admin and want to install this plug-in for all users in your organization, you can perform an [Admin Install](https://support.google.com/a/answer/172482?hl=en&ref_topic=1056395).

### Step 2: Open Google Sheets
Once you've installed the AWS Pricing Plug-in, you can get started using the plug-in by either:
* Going to Google Sheets and opening a new spreadsheet.
* Download a copy of one of Strake's pre-built templates:
    * EC2 On-Demand vs. Reserved Instance Pricing
    * RDS On-Demand vs. Reserved Instance Pricing
    * Strake Cloud Cost Calculator

### Step 3: Start Analyzing AWS Pricing Data
In the Main Navigation, go to Extensions --> AWS Pricing --> New Settings Sheet.

Starting a new sheet will prompt a short onboarding where you can see the sidebar with Documentation and links to more resources.
